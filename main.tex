\begin{abstract}
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a law regulation issued by the European Union. The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016 and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018.  This regulation aims to give individuals control over their personal data across the European Union and unify laws within the EU to facilitate international business. This regulation is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it has brought many benefits to individuals, but also, it has provided many challenges and obstacles to companies and organizations that control or process personal data. Despite unification and centralization of law regulation, there is no universal software solution for checking GDPR compliance. Therefore, to overcome some of the security challenges, companies pay expensive manual checking executed by lawyers or create their own solutions that do not apply to other organizations and industries. In this paper, we propose a solution in the form of a privacy meta-model and OCL validations which provides automatical checking for violations of the first fifty arts of the GDPR. Also, we will present usage of this meta-model on an example of a bank and plan of future development.

\section{Introduction}

\quad The world is an ever-changing paradigm. During different ages, various goods that were of value appeared. Thus, the data stood out as the "gold" of the 21st century. As such, they caused more and more frequent abuses, and their use had to be legally regulated. Digitalization and globalization have enabled the rapid growth and development of international business. Increased business movements have led to the problem of legislative inconsistencies between the countries in which it operates. To overcome this problem, the European Union adopted the GDPR, which unified privacy management and data protection. On the business side, this regulation caused a great deal of difficulty as companies had to adjust their business to the new rules in a brief period.
\newline \quad Many surveys conducted to determine how ready the market is for the new regulations. Based on Isaca survey \cite{isaca} the top five advantages related to GDPR compliance are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data discovery and mapping (59 per cent)
  \item Prioritizing GDPR compliance among other business priorities (47 per cent)
  \item Organizational education and change programs (45 per cent)
  \item Ensuring cross-departmental collaboration and buy-in (42 per cent)
  \item Preparation for data subject access or deletion requests (37 per cent).
\end{itemize}
\quad The Lipswitch survey\cite{lipswitch} has given the following results similar to the first survey. This survey reveals that 52 per cent of the examined companies admitted they were not ready to apply the GDPR, besides 35 per cent confessed to not knowing whether their IT policies and process were up to the job. The primary cause for this, to date, is that there is no single comprehensive solution that would be applicable and easy to integrate into all technologies. Therefore companies are most often forced to pay legal experts to study their business ecosystem. After that, based on those studies, the IT team designs a unique solution for their information system. The whole process is slow, expensive, and errors prone.\newline This paper aims to define a meta-model that can describe the real scenarios of using personal data in the information system and check whether their usage follows the GDPR. To achieve this goal, we used a model-driven approach, based on UML and Object Restricted Language (OCL) \cite{ocl}.
